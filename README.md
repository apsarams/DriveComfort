# DriveComfort
For self-driving cars to be accepted into society, the quality of their driving has to be uncompromising. Driving quality is not just provided by safety but also by the comfort of drive. When drivers feel comfortable and stress-free, they will be more in control of their cars. The same aspect applies to self-driving cars. Passengers should experience a smooth and comfortable drive. A drive can be completely safe, but if it is not comfortable, then it is disappointing and inadequate.
In my thesis, I focus on systematically testing and analyzing measurable quantities that indicate discomfort. This thesis explores the discomfort metrics defined in terms of gravitational forces acting on the car, hence working on its passengers. These discomfort metrics are analyzed using established research results to evaluate and assess the discomfort levels caused by self-driving car software. Automated test generation by random search and novelty search algorithms are applied to test the effect of curvy roads on passenger discomforts.
